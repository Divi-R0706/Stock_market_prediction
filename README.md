# Task-01
In this task, we build a simple Linear Regression model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. We load stock market data (such as Open, High, Low, Close prices), visualize the trend, and train a regression model to learn the relationship between past prices and future prices. The model then predicts the closing price for upcoming days.

# Task-02
This task analyzes messages to classify them as spam or ham using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. After cleaning and vectorizing the text, the model learns spam patterns and predicts whether new messages are spam with good accuracy.
