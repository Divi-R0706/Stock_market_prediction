# Stock_market_prediction
In this project, we build a simple Linear Regression model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. We load stock market data (such as Open, High, Low, Close prices), visualize the trend, and train a regression model to learn the relationship between past prices and future prices. The model then predicts the closing price for upcoming days.

We use Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn in Google Colab. The workflow includes:

Importing and cleaning stock market data

Selecting features like previous closing prices

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Training a Linear Regression model

Evaluating the model using loss functions such as MSE (Mean Squared Error)

Plotting actual vs predicted stock prices

This provides a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning for financial forecasting.
